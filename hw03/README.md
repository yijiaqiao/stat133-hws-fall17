# HW03 - Ranking NBA Teams

The purpose of this assignment is twofold. On one hand, the assignment is to keep working with data frames and producing plots but now using the packages "dplyr" and "ggplot2". On the other hand, it is time to start working with a little bit
more complex file structure.start working with data frames.

From the analytical point of view, we will focus on ranking tasks. This will give us an excuse to introduce Principal Components Analysis (PCA), from a narrow yet useful perspective.

One of the deliverables is to calculate a composite index to rank NBA teams.
