#**2. Quadratic equation:**

### _General Form:_
$ ax ^ 2 + bx + c = 0 $

### _Brief Description:_
In the above equation, x represents an unknown, and a, b, and c represent known numbers such that a is not equal to 0. If a = 0, then the equation is linear, not quadratic. The numbers a, b, and c are the coefficients of the equation, and may be distinguished by calling them, respectively, the quadratic coefficient, the linear coefficient and the constant or free term.

### _Roots:_
$x_1 =\frac{-b + \sqrt{b ^ 2 -4ac}}{2a}$

$x_2 =\frac{-b - \sqrt{b ^ 2 -4ac}}{2a}$

#**3. Comments and Reflections: **


#### 1. What things were hard, even though you saw them in class?
The most difficult thing when I started to use R is translating my thoughts in another programming languages, regarding previous experience in MATLAB and C++. They have different thoughts and slightly diffferent syntax but all in all, they give the basically same logic to deal with data. 

#### 2. What was easy(-ish) even though we haven't done it in class?
The markdown tutorial website helps me a lot and makes the learning process much eaiser even when I met some problems that we have not done in class yet.

#### 3. Was this the first time you were using markdown? If yes, how do you feel about it?
Yes, this was my first experience with markdown file. It's kind of simliar to LateX that I plan to learn recently. Hope by learning and using markdown, it would be easy for me to get started with LateX.

#### 4. If you have used markdown before, was there something new you learned while doing this assignment?
N/A.

#### 5. Did you need help to complete the assignment? If so, what kind of help? Who helped you?
Yes, I do need help from markdown tutorial website.

#### 6. How much time did it take to complete this HW?
I spent almost 90 minutes on this warmup HW.

#### 7. What was the most time consuming part?
I spent most time on working thorugh tutorails.
